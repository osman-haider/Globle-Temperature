Creating a comprehensive README file for your GitHub repository is crucial for helping others understand your project and how to use it. Here's a template for your README file:

# Global Temperature Prediction Project

This repository contains a project that predicts global temperatures based on latitude, longitude, year, month, day, latitude direction (north or south), and longitude direction (east or west) using a Logistic Regression model. The project includes data exploration, feature engineering, and a web application for temperature prediction.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle: [Global Temperature Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravduttakiit/global-temperature?select=GlobalLandTemperaturesByMajorCity.csv). The dataset provides historical temperature data for major cities.

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used in the project.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and feature engineering.
- `src/`: Source code for the model and web application.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python dependencies required for the project.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA notebook (`notebooks/EDA.ipynb`) explores the dataset, visualizes key trends, and identifies patterns in the temperature data.

## Feature Engineering

The Feature Engineering notebook (`notebooks/FeatureEngineering.ipynb`) outlines the process of selecting and creating relevant features for the temperature prediction model.

## Model Training

The model for temperature prediction is implemented in `src/model.py`. It uses Logistic Regression for prediction. The choice of this model is based on its performance as indicated by the R2 score.

## Web Application

A web application for temperature prediction is created using Streamlit and can be found in `src/app.py`. Users can input latitude, longitude, year, month, day, latitude direction (north or south), and longitude direction (east or west) to get a temperature prediction.

## Deployment

The web application is deployed on [back4app](https://globletemperature-gusmang525.b4a.run/). You can access it [here](https://globletemperature-gusmang525.b4a.run/).

## Usage

1. Visit the deployed website: [Global Temperature Prediction](https://globletemperature-gusmang525.b4a.run/).
2. Enter the required values (latitude, longitude, year, month, day, latitude direction, and longitude direction).
3. Click the "Predict Temperature" button to get the temperature prediction.
